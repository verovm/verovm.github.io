Welcome to the Vero Virtual Machine page. We are a group of academics and students who are interested in the programmability of blockchains. In particular, we would like to have a deeper understanding of the efficiency and reliability of executing Smart Contracts on the block chain. 

We will report about our findings throughout the project on this webpage. 

The project is partially funded and supported by [Fantom Foundation](https://fantom.foundation), Yonsei University and The University of Sydney.
